Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

    For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

Example 3:

Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
